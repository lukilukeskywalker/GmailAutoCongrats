# GmailAutoCongrats
Google script to auto congratulate your friends, so you don't have to!


<h1>So what is this?</h1>
It is just a simple script that gets trigered everyday and replies all messages inside a gmail label, in my case <it>Cumplea√±os</it> (Birthday in spanish) creating a simple but fun HTML birthday card. This card contains a random gif from Giphy, a random motivational quote, a random shower thought from weeks top 100 posts in [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/top/?t=week)
