# GmailAutoCongrats
Google script to auto congratulate your friends, so you don't have to!


<h1>So what is this?</h1>
It is just a simple script that gets trigered everyday and replies all messages inside a gmail label, in my case <it>Cumplea√±os</it> (Birthday in spanish) creating a simple but fun HTML birthday card. This card contains a random gif from Giphy, a random motivational quote, a random shower thought from weeks top 100 posts in [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/top/?t=week) At the end it also includes a random Birtday Best Wishes quote extracted from a json file hosted in [github](https://github.com/itriplek/birthday-quotes-with-relationships/blob/master/birthday-quotes-with-relationship-formatted.json)
